# Subscription Status Fix - Summary

## Issue
The browser extension was always showing "kostenlos" (free) status even for users who had subscribed. The problem was that subscription status should be determined by checking if `stripe_customer_id` exists in Clerk's **privateMetadata**, but the extension was incorrectly trying to read from `publicMetadata.subscription_status`.

## Root Cause
- Clerk stores `stripe_customer_id` in **privateMetadata** when a user subscribes
- `privateMetadata` is **only accessible server-side**, not from client-side JavaScript
- The extension was trying to read subscription status directly from Clerk's user object, which doesn't expose privateMetadata

## Solution Implemented

### Extension Changes (Complete ‚úÖ)
The extension has been updated to:

1. **During Login** (`src/auth.js`):
   - After successful Clerk authentication
   - Call backend API `GET /api/auth/subscription-status` with session token
   - Backend checks `privateMetadata.stripe_customer_id` and returns subscription status
   - Store subscription status locally

2. **On Status Refresh** (`auth.js` - `verifyAndRefreshAuth()` and `refreshSubscriptionStatus()`):
   - Call backend API to get latest subscription status
   - Update local storage with new status

3. **Built & Deployed**:
   - Changes compiled into `dist/js/bundle-auth.js`
   - Ready for use once backend is implemented

### Files Modified
- `src/auth.js` - Added backend API call during login
- `auth.js` - Updated verifyAndRefreshAuth() to fetch subscription status from backend
- `auth.js` - Updated comments to clarify subscription determination logic
- `dist/js/bundle-auth.js` - Built output with changes
- `STRIPE_INTEGRATION.md` - Updated documentation
- `BACKEND_SUBSCRIPTION_FIX.md` - New implementation guide

## What's Next

### Backend Implementation Required üìã

The backend must be updated to support the extension changes. See **BACKEND_SUBSCRIPTION_FIX.md** for complete details.

**Required Changes:**

1. **Implement `/api/auth/subscription-status` Endpoint**
   ```
   GET /api/auth/subscription-status
   Authorization: Bearer <clerk-session-token>
   
   Response:
   {
     "subscription_status": "subscribed" | "free",
     "plan_id": "price_xxxxx",
     "current_period_end": "2024-12-31T23:59:59.000Z"
   }
   ```
   
   Logic:
   - Verify Clerk session token
   - Get user from Clerk API
   - Check `user.privateMetadata.stripe_customer_id`
   - Return "subscribed" if exists, "free" if not

2. **Update Stripe Webhook Handler**
   - Store `stripe_customer_id` in privateMetadata when subscription created
   - Remove `stripe_customer_id` when subscription canceled/deleted
   - Use `undefined` (not `null`) to properly delete the field

3. **Configure CORS**
   - Allow requests from `chrome-extension://*` and `moz-extension://*`

## Testing Instructions

Once backend is deployed:

### Test Free User
1. Clerk Dashboard ‚Üí Users ‚Üí Select user ‚Üí Private metadata
2. Ensure `stripe_customer_id` is NOT present
3. Login to extension
4. Should show "Kostenlos"/"Free" with 10 analyses/day limit

### Test Subscribed User
1. Clerk Dashboard ‚Üí Users ‚Üí Select user ‚Üí Private metadata
2. Set: `{ "stripe_customer_id": "cus_xxx" }`
3. Login to extension
4. Should show "Abonniert"/"Subscribed" with 100 analyses/day limit

### Test Full Flow
1. Create test subscription via Stripe
2. Verify webhook sets `stripe_customer_id` in privateMetadata
3. Login to extension ‚Üí should show subscribed status
4. Cancel subscription
5. Verify webhook removes `stripe_customer_id`
6. Click "Refresh Status" ‚Üí should show free status

## Key Technical Details

### Why privateMetadata?
- `privateMetadata` is only accessible server-side (more secure)
- Prevents client-side manipulation of subscription status
- Stripe customer IDs should not be exposed to client-side

### Why Backend API?
- Extension cannot access `privateMetadata` directly
- Backend can verify Clerk session token securely
- Backend can query both Clerk and Stripe APIs
- Centralizes subscription logic in one place

### Field Deletion
- Use `undefined` (not `null` or empty string) when removing `stripe_customer_id`
- This ensures the field is completely deleted from metadata
- Example: `privateMetadata: { stripe_customer_id: undefined }`

## Documentation
