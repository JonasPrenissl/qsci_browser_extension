### 2. Subscription Management
- ✅ Check subscription status from Clerk user metadata
- ✅ Display subscription badge (Free/Subscribed)
- ✅ Different usage limits based on subscription:
  - Free users (registered): 10 analyses per day
  - Subscribed users (registered): 100 analyses per day

### 3. Usage Tracking
- ✅ Track daily analysis count
- ✅ Automatic reset at midnight
- ✅ Real-time usage display (e.g., "5 / 10")
- ✅ Pre-analysis validation of limits
- ✅ Post-analysis usage increment

### 4. User Interface
- ✅ Single "Login with Clerk" button in popup (shown when not authenticated)
- ✅ Pop-up window with Clerk authentication UI
- ✅ User status section (shown when authenticated)

## Clerk Requirements

The extension requires:

### Clerk Account Setup
1. Create a Clerk account at https://clerk.com
2. Create a new application
3. Get publishable key from Clerk dashboard
4. Note your Frontend API URL

### Configuration
1. Update `clerk-auth.html` with:
   - Your Clerk publishable key (2 places)
   - Your Clerk Frontend API URL
2. Configure Clerk application:
   - Add extension redirect URL
   - Enable sign-up if desired
   - Configure authentication methods

### User Metadata
Set `subscription_status` in user's `publicMetadata`:
```json
{
  "subscription_status": "free" | "subscribed"
}
```

This can be set via:
- Clerk Dashboard (manual)
- Clerk API (programmatic)
- Webhooks (automated on subscription changes)

## How to Test

### Without Clerk (Local Testing)
1. Load extension in Chrome (developer mode)
2. Open browser console and run:
```javascript
chrome.storage.local.set({
  'qsci_auth_token': 'test_token_12345',
  'qsci_user_email': 'test@example.com',
  'qsci_user_id': 'test_user_id',
  'qsci_clerk_session_id': 'test_session',
  'qsci_subscription_status': 'free'
});
```
3. Reopen extension popup
4. Test analysis features on supported sites

### With Clerk
1. Set up Clerk account and application
2. Update clerk-auth.html with your Clerk keys
3. Load extension in Chrome
