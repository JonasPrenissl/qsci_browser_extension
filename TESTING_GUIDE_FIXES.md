5. Sign in with valid credentials or create a new account
6. **Expected:** After successful sign-in, you should see:
   - Console logs: "Q-SCI Clerk Auth: Session detected, user signed in"
   - Success message: "Erfolg! Sie k√∂nnen dieses Fenster schlie√üen."
   - Popup window closes automatically after 2 seconds
7. Extension popup should update to show:
   - User email
   - Subscription status badge (Free/Premium)
   - Daily usage counter (0 / 10 or 0 / 100)

### Success Criteria
‚úÖ Clerk auth window opens
‚úÖ Sign-in form appears
‚úÖ User can complete sign-in

## Regression Testing Checklist

Ensure existing functionality still works:
- [ ] Popup opens and displays correctly
- [ ] Settings button opens options page
- [ ] Language switcher works
- [ ] Manual text analysis works
- [ ] Detailed analysis view works
- [ ] Export analysis works
- [ ] Logout works

- [ ] PDF analysis toggle works
- [ ] Subscription refresh button works

## Performance Testing

### Metrics to Monitor
- Time to login: Should complete within 10-30 seconds
- Time to fetch API key: Should complete within 1-2 seconds
- Time for analysis: Should complete within 20-60 seconds
- Popup load time: Should be < 1 second

## Security Testing

### Checks
- [ ] Auth token is stored securely in chrome.storage.local
- [ ] API key is never logged to console in production
- [ ] HTTPS is used for all backend requests
- [ ] Clerk token is sent in Authorization header, not URL
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed in error messages

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Clerk auth stuck at "Loading..."
**Check:**

- OPENAI_API_KEY is set in backend environment

### Issue: "OpenAI API request failed"
**Check:**
- API key retrieved from backend is valid
- OpenAI API is accessible
- API key has sufficient credits
- Request body is properly formatted

## Sign-Off

After completing all tests:
- [ ] All test scenarios pass
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Translations work correctly
