# Clerk Authentication Fix - Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Quick Checklist for Deploying the Fix

Use this checklist to deploy the Clerk authentication fix that resolves the "Invalid URL scheme" error.

### 1. Preparation ‚úÖ

- [ ] Review the fix: Read [CLERK_EXTENSION_AUTH_FIX_SUMMARY.md](CLERK_EXTENSION_AUTH_FIX_SUMMARY.md)
- [ ] Understand the flow: Website handles auth, sends token to extension
- [ ] Have access to your website (www.q-sci.org)
- [ ] Have access to Clerk dashboard

### 2. Deploy Website Pages üåê

- [ ] Copy `website/extension-login.html` to your website
- [ ] Copy `website/extension-auth-success.html` to your website
- [ ] Ensure pages are accessible at:
  - [ ] `https://www.q-sci.org/extension-login`
  - [ ] `https://www.q-sci.org/extension-auth-success`
- [ ] Test pages load (visit URLs in browser)

**Quick test:**
```bash
curl -I https://www.q-sci.org/extension-login
curl -I https://www.q-sci.org/extension-auth-success
# Both should return 200 OK
```

### 3. Configure Clerk Dashboard üîê

- [ ] Go to https://dashboard.clerk.com
- [ ] Select your application
- [ ] Navigate to **Paths** or **Allowed Redirect URLs**
- [ ] Add these URLs:
  - [ ] `https://www.q-sci.org/extension-login`
  - [ ] `https://www.q-sci.org/extension-auth-success`
- [ ] Save changes
- [ ] Verify URLs are in the list

### 4. Update Production Keys (If Using Production) üîë

**For development/testing:** Skip this step (test keys work)

**For production:**
- [ ] Get production Clerk key from dashboard (starts with `pk_live_`)
- [ ] Update in `website/extension-login.html`:
  - [ ] Line ~176: `data-clerk-publishable-key="pk_live_..."`
  - [ ] Line ~205: `const clerk = new Clerk('pk_live_...');`
- [ ] Update in `website/extension-auth-success.html`:
  - [ ] Line ~129: `data-clerk-publishable-key="pk_live_..."`
  - [ ] Line ~158: `const clerk = new Clerk('pk_live_...');`
- [ ] Re-deploy updated files to website

### 5. Test Extension üß™

- [ ] Load extension in Chrome (`chrome://extensions/`)
- [ ] Click extension icon to open popup
- [ ] Click "Login with Clerk" button
- [ ] **Verify:**
  - [ ] New tab opens to your website login page
  - [ ] Clerk login UI appears
  - [ ] Can sign in with email/password
  - [ ] After login, redirects to success page
  - [ ] Success page shows "Authentication successful!"
  - [ ] Tab auto-closes after 2 seconds
  - [ ] Extension popup shows you as logged in
  - [ ] User email is displayed
  - [ ] No "Invalid URL scheme" error ‚úÖ

### 6. Test OAuth Providers üîó

Test with at least one OAuth provider:

- [ ] Click "Continue with Google" (or another provider)
- [ ] Complete OAuth flow
- [ ] **Verify:**
  - [ ] OAuth callback works (no errors)
  - [ ] Redirects to success page (HTTPS URL)
  - [ ] Token sent to extension
  - [ ] Tab closes
  - [ ] Extension shows logged in
  - [ ] **No "Invalid URL scheme" error** ‚úÖ

### 7. Test Logout and Re-login üîÑ

- [ ] Click logout in extension
- [ ] Verify logged out state
- [ ] Click login again
- [ ] Complete authentication
- [ ] Verify logged in again
- [ ] Works correctly

### 8. Verify Console (Optional but Recommended) üîç

**Extension popup console (F12 in popup):**
```
‚úÖ Q-SCI Auth: Opening Clerk authentication pop-up...
‚úÖ Q-SCI Auth: Received authentication success from Clerk
‚úÖ Should NOT see: "Invalid URL scheme"
```

**Login page console:**
```
‚úÖ Q-SCI Extension Login: Clerk initialized
‚úÖ Q-SCI Extension Login: Sign-in component mounted
```

**Success page console:**
```
‚úÖ Q-SCI Auth Success: User authenticated
‚úÖ Q-SCI Auth Success: Sending auth data to extension via postMessage
```

### 9. Production Deployment (If Not Already Done) üöÄ

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Using production Clerk keys
- [ ] Website pages deployed to production
- [ ] Clerk dashboard configured
- [ ] Extension works in production
- [ ] Monitor for errors in first 24 hours

### 10. Documentation Updates üìö

- [ ] Update internal docs with deployment info
- [ ] Notify team of authentication flow change
- [ ] Keep test and production Clerk keys documented
- [ ] Note website pages need to stay deployed
