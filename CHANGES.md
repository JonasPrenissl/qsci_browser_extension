# Clerk Integration - What Changed

This document summarizes the changes made to integrate Clerk authentication into the Q-SCI browser extension.

## Overview

The extension now uses **Clerk** for user authentication instead of a traditional email/password form. Users authenticate through a pop-up window with Clerk's hosted UI.

## Key Changes

### 1. Authentication Method
- **Before**: Email/password form directly in extension popup
- **After**: Single "Login with Clerk" button that opens a pop-up window

### 2. User Registration
- **Before**: Users would register on q-sci.org website
- **After**: Users can sign up directly through Clerk's UI (in the pop-up)

### 3. Subscription Status
- **Before**: Stored in backend database, retrieved via API
- **After**: Stored in Clerk's user metadata (`publicMetadata.subscription_status`)

### 4. Session Management
- **Before**: JWT tokens from backend
- **After**: Clerk session tokens

## Visual Changes

### Before: Login Form
```
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│ Login Required                 │
│                                │
│ Email: [________________]      │
│ Password: [____________]       │
│                                │
│ [       Login        ]         │
│                                │
│ Don't have an account?         │
│ Visit q-sci.org to register    │
└────────────────────────────────┘
```

### After: Clerk Login Button
```
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│ Login Required                 │
│                                │

│ [ 🔐 Login with Clerk ]        │
│                                │
│ ┌───────────────────────────┐  │
│ │ What you get:             │  │
│ │ • Free: 10 analyses/day   │  │
│ │ • Subscribed: 100/day     │  │
│ └───────────────────────────┘  │
└────────────────────────────────┘
```

When user clicks the button, a pop-up window opens with Clerk's authentication UI.

## User Experience Flow

### Before
1. User opens extension
2. Sees email/password form
3. Enters credentials
4. Extension calls backend API
5. Backend validates and returns token
6. User is logged in

### After
1. User opens extension
2. Sees "Login with Clerk" button
3. Clicks button
4. Pop-up window opens with Clerk UI
5. User signs in or signs up through Clerk
6. Clerk authenticates user
7. Pop-up sends data back to extension
8. Pop-up closes automatically
9. User is logged in

## Developer Experience

### Before: Setting Up Backend
1. Set up database for users
2. Implement password hashing
3. Create login API endpoint
4. Create verification API endpoint
5. Set up JWT token generation
6. Configure CORS
7. Deploy backend

### After: Setting Up Clerk
1. Create Clerk account (5 minutes)
2. Get publishable key
3. Update clerk-auth.html with key (2 places)
4. Configure redirect URLs
5. Done!

## Security Improvements

### Before
- Extension handled passwords (even if not stored)
- Custom authentication logic
- Backend needs password storage
- Manual token management

### After
- Extension never sees passwords
- Clerk handles all authentication
- No password storage needed
- Clerk manages sessions and security
- Built-in security features (2FA, etc.)

## Usage Limits (Unchanged)

Both before and after:
- **Free users**: 10 analyses per day
- **Subscribed users**: 100 analyses per day

The only difference is how subscription status is stored:
- Before: Backend database
- After: Clerk user metadata

## Breaking Changes

⚠️ **Important**: This is a breaking change for existing users.

If you had users authenticated with the old system:
1. They will need to re-authenticate with Clerk
2. Old tokens will not work
3. Previous authentication data will be ignored

### Migration Path

If you have existing users:
1. Export user list from old backend
2. Create corresponding users in Clerk
3. Set their subscription status in Clerk metadata
4. Users will need to reset password (first login with Clerk)

## Testing Requirements

To test the new system:
1. Create a Clerk account
2. Configure clerk-auth.html
3. Load extension in Chrome
4. Test authentication flow
5. Set subscription status in Clerk
6. Test usage limits

See CLERK_SETUP.md for detailed testing instructions.

## Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback to the old authentication:
1. Checkout the previous commit
2. Re-deploy old version
3. Existing backend API still needed

## Next Steps

1. **For Developers**: See CLERK_SETUP.md
2. **For Users**: Just use the extension - Clerk handles everything
3. **For Admins**: Set up webhooks to sync subscription status

## Questions?

- See CLERK_SETUP.md for setup questions
- See AUTHENTICATION.md for technical details
- See README_CLERK.md for quick overview

## Summary

✅ Simpler authentication flow  
✅ More secure (Clerk handles security)  
✅ Easier to maintain (no backend auth code)  
✅ Better user experience (familiar Clerk UI)  
✅ Same usage limits (10/100 per day)  
✅ Subscription status from Clerk metadata  

The integration makes authentication more secure and easier to manage while maintaining all existing functionality.
