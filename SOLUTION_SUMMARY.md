# Solution Summary - Q-SCI Browser Extension Issues

## Original Problem Statement (German)

> wenn ich versuche app als extension zu installieren kommt: Datei
> \\network.domain\homes\user\Dokumente\Forschung\Q-SCI Project\Q_SCI on Github\APP 1
> 
> Fehler: Das Hintergrundskript „background.js" konnte nicht geladen werden. Fix it. Also make sure that the login and subscription check via Clerk integration works and that people without subscription but with registration can do 10 analyses per day and people with subscription and registration can do 100 analyses per day. Also make sure only logged in persons can use the browser extension

## Translation
"When I try to install the app as an extension I get: File \\network.domain\homes\user\Documents\Research\Q-SCI Project\Q_SCI on Github\APP 1
Error: The background script 'background.js' could not be loaded. Fix it. Also make sure that the login and subscription check via Clerk integration works and that people without subscription but with registration can do 10 analyses per day and people with subscription and registration can do 100 analyses per day. Also make sure only logged in persons can use the browser extension"

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Background Script Loading Error
**Cause**: Chrome extensions cannot be loaded from network drives or UNC paths.

**Evidence**: The error shows path `\\network.domain\homes\user\...` which is a **network UNC path**. Chrome's extension system has security restrictions that prevent loading from network locations.

**Solution**: Extension must be copied to a **local hard drive** (C:\, D:\, etc.) before loading in Chrome.

### Issue 2: Authentication Requirements
**Status**: ✅ Already implemented correctly

The extension already has:
- Clerk authentication integration via popup
- Login requirement before any analysis
- Proper access control with disabled buttons when not logged in

### Issue 3: Usage Limits
**Status**: ✅ Already implemented correctly

The extension already has:
- Free users: 10 analyses per day (as required)
- Subscribed users: 100 analyses per day (as required)
- Daily reset at midnight
- Subscription status from Clerk user metadata

### Issue 4: Login Requirement
**Status**: ✅ Already implemented correctly

The extension already:
- Disables analyze buttons when not logged in
- Checks authentication before any analysis
- Shows login form when not authenticated
- Blocks analysis attempts without login

## Solutions Implemented

2. Login
3. Usage shows "X / 100"
4. Badge shows "✓ Subscribed" (green)
5. Can perform up to 100 analyses

### ✅ Requirement 5: Only logged in users can use the extension
**Status**: Already implemented and verified

   - Clicking buttons does nothing
   - Shows "Login Required" message
2. After login:
   - Buttons become enabled
   - Can perform analyses
   - Usage counter updates

## Code Quality Verification

### JavaScript Syntax Validation
All files passed Node.js syntax check:
```
✓ background.js
✓ popup.js
✓ auth.js
✓ content-script.js
✓ qsci_evaluator.js
✓ options.js
```

### Authentication Flow
```
User clicks extension icon
  → Shows login form if not authenticated
  → Disables analyze buttons
  
User clicks "Login with Clerk"
  → Opens Clerk auth popup
  → User authenticates with Clerk
  → Extension receives token and user data
  → Stores in chrome.storage.local
  → Shows user status (email, subscription, usage)
  → Enables analyze buttons
  
User analyzes paper
  → Checks authentication (must be logged in)
  → Checks usage limit (based on subscription)
  → Performs analysis if allowed
  → Increments usage counter
  → Updates display
```

### Usage Tracking Flow
```
New day starts
  → Daily usage resets to 0
  
User performs analysis
  → Check current usage
  → Compare with limit (10 or 100)
  → If under limit:
      → Allow analysis
      → Increment counter
      → Update display
  → If at limit:
      → Block analysis
      → Show error message
      → Show upgrade prompt (if free user)
```
