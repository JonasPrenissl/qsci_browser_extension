# Subscription Status Display Fix

## Problem
When users logged in with accounts that already have active subscriptions, the extension incorrectly displayed them as "free" accounts with a 10 analyses/day limit instead of showing "subscribed" with 100 analyses/day.

## Root Cause
The subscription status fetching code in `clerk-auth-main.js` was defaulting to 'free' status whenever the backend API call to `/api/auth/subscription-status` failed due to:
- Network errors
- Backend server being down or not responding
- CORS issues
- 404/500 errors from the backend

Since the backend API is the authoritative source for checking `privateMetadata.stripe_customer_id` (which is only accessible server-side), when it failed, there was no fallback mechanism to determine if a user was actually subscribed.

## Solution
Added a fallback mechanism that checks the Clerk user's `publicMetadata.plan_id` field when the backend API call fails. This field is set by the backend webhook when processing Stripe subscription events and is accessible client-side.

### Logic Flow
1. **Primary Method**: Call backend API `/api/auth/subscription-status`
   - If successful → Use the returned subscription status
   
2. **Fallback Method** (when backend fails):
   - Check if `user.publicMetadata.plan_id` exists and is not empty
   - If yes → User is subscribed (has an active Stripe plan)
   - If no → User is on free tier

## Technical Details

### Changes Made
**File: `src/clerk-auth-main.js`**
- Added fallback logic in the `handleSignInSuccess()` function
- When backend API call fails (non-OK response or exception), check `user.publicMetadata.plan_id`
- If `plan_id` exists, set `subscriptionStatus = 'subscribed'`
- Added detailed console logging for debugging

### How It Works
According to the backend webhook implementation (see `BACKEND_SUBSCRIPTION_FIX.md`), when a Stripe subscription is created or updated, the backend webhook stores:

```javascript
// In privateMetadata (server-side only)
{
  "stripe_customer_id": "cus_xxxxx"
}

// In publicMetadata (client-accessible)
{
  "plan_id": "price_xxxxx",
  "current_period_end": "2024-12-31T23:59:59.000Z"
}
```

The presence of `plan_id` in publicMetadata indicates an active subscription, making it a reliable fallback when the backend API is unavailable.

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

#### Test 1: Subscribed User with Working Backend
1. Ensure backend API is running and accessible
2. Log in with a subscribed user (has `plan_id` in publicMetadata)
3. **Expected Result**: Shows "Abonniert" / "Subscribed" with 100 analyses/day limit
4. Check console logs for: "Fetched subscription status from backend: subscribed"

#### Test 2: Subscribed User with Backend Failure
1. Simulate backend failure (disconnect network, block API endpoint, etc.)
2. Log in with a subscribed user (has `plan_id` in publicMetadata)
3. **Expected Result**: Shows "Abonniert" / "Subscribed" with 100 analyses/day limit
4. Check console logs for: "Using publicMetadata fallback - user has plan_id, treating as subscribed"

#### Test 3: Free User with Working Backend
1. Ensure backend API is running
2. Log in with a free user (no `plan_id` in publicMetadata)
3. **Expected Result**: Shows "Kostenlos" / "Free" with 10 analyses/day limit
4. Check console logs for: "Fetched subscription status from backend: free"

#### Test 4: Free User with Backend Failure
1. Simulate backend failure
2. Log in with a free user (no `plan_id` in publicMetadata)
3. **Expected Result**: Shows "Kostenlos" / "Free" with 10 analyses/day limit
4. Check console logs for: "No plan_id in publicMetadata, defaulting to free"

### Setting Up Test Users

#### Create a Subscribed Test User
1. Go to Clerk Dashboard → Users → Select user
2. Click "Public metadata" tab
3. Add:
   ```json
   {
     "plan_id": "price_test123",
     "current_period_end": "2024-12-31T23:59:59.000Z"
   }
   ```
4. Save changes

#### Create a Free Test User
1. Go to Clerk Dashboard → Users → Select user
2. Ensure "Public metadata" is empty: `{}`

### Automated Test Results
The logic has been validated with unit tests showing:
- ✓ Subscribed users are correctly identified when backend works
- ✓ Subscribed users remain subscribed when backend fails (fallback works)
- ✓ Free users are correctly identified when backend works
- ✓ Free users remain free when backend fails

## Console Logging
The fix includes detailed console logging to help debug subscription status issues:

```javascript
// When backend succeeds
"Q-SCI Clerk Auth: Fetched subscription status from backend: subscribed"

// When backend fails but user is subscribed
"Q-SCI Clerk Auth: Failed to fetch subscription status from backend, status: 500"
"Q-SCI Clerk Auth: Using publicMetadata fallback - user has plan_id, treating as subscribed"

// When backend fails and user is free
"Q-SCI Clerk Auth: Network error"
"Q-SCI Clerk Auth: Network error and no plan_id in publicMetadata, defaulting to free tier"
```

## Known Limitations
1. The fallback relies on `publicMetadata.plan_id` being correctly set by backend webhooks
2. If a subscription is cancelled but the webhook hasn't updated publicMetadata yet, the user may still appear as subscribed
3. The fallback cannot distinguish between different subscription statuses (active vs past_due)

## Recommendations
1. Ensure backend webhooks are properly configured to update publicMetadata
2. Monitor backend API availability to minimize reliance on fallback
3. Consider adding a "Refresh Status" button to allow users to manually update their subscription status when backend is available
